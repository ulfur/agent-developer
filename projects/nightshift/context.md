Nightshift is the core platform that powers the Task queue, Codex execution flow, and the supporting backend/frontend. Keep the system self-hostable on a Raspberry Pi 5 class device, lean on Vue 3 + Vuetify for UI work, and prefer standard-library Python on the backend.

Focus efforts on maintaining reliable prompt execution, realtime visibility, and clear documentation for future agents. When making changes, ensure the host stays easy to operate headlessly and keep the project-specific instructions in `projects/nightshift/agents.md` up to date.
